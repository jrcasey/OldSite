> Aloha and thank you for visiting! Here you'll find 
a few blurbs about me and my research, as well as some 
repo's that you're more than welcome to fork. First, a
bit about me and what I'm interested in:

>I am a microbial oceanographer fascinated by the 
many roles microbes play in regulating elemental 
cycles and the transduction of energy in the marine 
ecosystem. Combining field observations, laboratory 
experiments, theoretical and computational models, I 
have the lofty goal of working to build toward a 
mechanistic model of microbial life in the 
oceans. New theory is needed to bridge the gap from 
high-frequency cellular-scale 
processes to those of the larger marine ecosystem, 
but a fundamental understanding of the time and space 
scales over which microbes process information is 
lacking. I am motivated to understand the 
optimization of cellular scale processes, how objectives
are influenced by communication between 
tiers of biological organization, and how 
all this complexity is imprinted in the genetic code.
