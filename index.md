> Aloha and thank you for visiting! Here you'll find 
a few blurbs about me and my research, publications, talks,
as well as some repo's that you're more than welcome to fork. 
First, a bit about me and my current interests:

> I am fascinated by the microbial world and its regulation of elemental 
cycles and the transduction of energy in the marine 
ecosystem. To make sense of the coordination of 
thousands of microbial populations interacting 
through a web of thousands of chemical conduits, all 
dynamically adapting to an ever-changing environment
is one hell of a task, but... a poil! 

> Combining field observations, laboratory 
experiments, theoretical and computational models, I 
have the lofty goal (or fool's errand) of working to build toward a 
mechanistic model of microbial life in the 
oceans. New theory is needed to bridge the gap from 
high-frequency cellular-scale 
processes to those of the larger marine ecosystem, 
and a fundamental understanding of the time and space 
scales over which microbes explore their fitness 
landscape and process information is 
lacking. I am motivated to explore the 
optimization of cellular scale processes, how objectives
are influenced by communication between 
tiers of biological organization, and how 
all this complexity is imprinted in the
genetic code.
