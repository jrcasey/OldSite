####  Constraint-based Modeling of Marine Microbial Community Metabolism and Physiology

With Mick Follows and collaborators within the [CBIOMES 
Project](https://cbiomes.org), I am designing detailed 
models of microbial metabolism and physiology and 
using these models to simulate microbial community 
dynamics in the marine environment.
