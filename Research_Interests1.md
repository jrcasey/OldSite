## Microbial Oceanography

I am a microbial oceanographer interested 
in the many roles microbes play in regulating elemental 
cycles and the transduction of energy in the marine 
ecosystem. Combining field observations, laboratory 
experiments, theoretical and computational models, I 
am working to build toward a mechanistic understanding 
of microbial life in the oceans. New theory is needed 
to bridge the gap from high-frequency cellular-scale 
processes to those of the larger marine ecosystem, 
but a fundamental understanding of the time and space 
scales over which microbes processes information is 
lacking. I am motivated to understand the 
objectives of cellular scale processes, how those 
objectives are influenced by communication between 
higher tiers of biological organization, and how 
they are imprinted in the genetic code. With Mick 
Follows and collaborators within the CBIOMES 
initiative (cbiomes.org), I am designing detailed 
models of microbial metabolism and physiology and 
using these models to simulate microbial community 
dynamics in the marine environment.
